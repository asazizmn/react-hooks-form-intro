# React Hooks Form Intro
Another beginner React project that experiments with building a basic form using hooks. It looks into managing form state, validation and submission handling. The single page application environment was bootstrapped using `create-react-app` and builds a simple form that provides realtime validation feedback. 

Please note that this project was based on the "Beginner React Project - How to Build Basic Forms Using React Hooks" tutorial by Chris Blakely... Albeit with some minor differences.
