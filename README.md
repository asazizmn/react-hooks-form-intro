# React Hooks Form Intro
Another beginner React project that experiments with building a basic form using hooks. It looks into managing form state, validation and submission handling. The single-page application environment was bootstrapped using `create-react-app` and builds a simple form that provides validation feedback. 

Please note that this project was originally based on the "Beginner React Project - How to Build Basic Forms Using React Hooks" tutorial by Chris Blakely. However, in terms of the code and the design, it took its own course eventually. 

Some of the improvements include the following.
* Better colour coding (ie green for success, etc)
* Simplified interface (ie showing "success" message in place of register button)
* Disabling the register button until all the provided values are valid
* Added some eye candies (ie "fade-in" transitioning during message feedback)


## Installation
1. Ensure that requirements such as git, node and npm are already installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
2. Clone or download the project to an appropriate local folder
3. Install project dependencies by executing `npm install` in a terminal from the project directory root
4. Thereafter, run the application by executing `npm start`
5. Now finally view `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser
